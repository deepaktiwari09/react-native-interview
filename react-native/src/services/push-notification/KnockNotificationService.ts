/**
 * @file KnockNotificationService.ts
 * Handles integration with Knock (knock.app) for notifications.
 * Knock is primarily a backend/API platform for managing notification logic and delivery across multiple channels.
 * This service focuses on the React Native client-side aspects:
 * 1. Receiving standard push notifications (FCM/APNS) triggered *by* Knock.
 * 2. Using Knock's React Native SDK for features like In-App Feeds and real-time updates.
 *
 * Assumes a separate service (like Notifee/FCM or Expo) handles the actual *display* of push notifications.
 * This service complements that by interacting with Knock's specific features.
 *
 * --- DETAILED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ---\
 *
 * **Core Concepts & Architecture (Knock Specific):**
 * - What is Knock? How does it position itself differently from OneSignal or sending pushes directly? (Focus on notification infrastructure, multi-channel orchestration, developer API).
 * - Explain the typical workflow involving Knock: User action -> Your Backend -> Knock API (Trigger Workflow) -> Knock sends via configured channels (FCM, APNS, Email, SMS, Slack, In-App) -> Client receives.
 * - What are Knock Workflows, Channels, and Preferences? How do they work together?
 * - What is the role of the Knock User ID? How does it relate to your internal user ID and the device token (FCM/APNS/Expo)? (`knock.identify()`).
 * - What is a Knock Channel ID? How is it obtained for push notification channels (FCM/APNS)? (Knock SDK registers the device token and returns a Knock Channel ID).
 * - What are Knock In-App Feeds? How do they work? (Real-time feed powered by Knock, accessed via SDK).
 * - Discuss the pros and cons of using Knock. (Pros: Centralized logic, multi-channel, preferences management, developer focus. Cons: Yet another service/cost, complexity, client SDK might be less mature than push-only providers).
 *
 * **Client SDK Integration (`@knocklabs/react-native`):**
 * - What setup is required for the `@knocklabs/react-native` SDK? (API Key, potentially other config).
 * - Explain the purpose of `KnockProvider` and the `useKnockClient` hook.
 * - How do you identify the current user to Knock using the SDK? (`knock.identify()`). When should this be called? (After user login).
 * - How do you register a device's push notification token (FCM/APNS) with Knock to get a Knock Push Channel ID? (`knock.registerPushChannel()`). Why is this necessary? (So Knock knows where to send pushes for this user/device).
 * - How do you handle un-identifying a user on logout? (`knock.signOut()`).
 *
 * **Receiving Knock-Triggered Pushes:**
 * - If Knock triggers an FCM/APNS push notification, which service *actually* receives and displays it on the device? (Your configured push service: Notifee/FCM, Expo Notifications, OneSignal SDK, etc.).
 * - How would you typically structure the data payload sent from Knock in a push notification to include information needed for navigation or client-side handling? (Custom data in the Knock workflow/template).
 * - How does this `KnockNotificationService` interact with the service that *displays* the push (e.g., `NotificationService` using Notifee)? (It likely doesn't directly; the display service handles the push, and this service handles Knock-specific features like feeds).
 *
 * **In-App Feeds & Real-time:**
 * - How do you use the Knock SDK to render an In-App Feed? (`useFeedStore`, `<NotificationFeedProvider>`, `<NotificationFeed />`).
 * - How does the feed update in real-time? (WebSockets managed by the Knock SDK).
 * - How do you mark feed items as read or seen? (Methods provided by the SDK/feed store).
 * - How can you customize the appearance of the In-App Feed? (Custom render functions, styling).
 *
 * **Preferences:**
 * - Can users manage their notification preferences (e.g., enable/disable specific channels or notification types) via the client SDK? (Yes, Knock provides APIs/SDK methods for fetching and updating preferences).
 * - How would you build a settings screen for managing Knock preferences? (`usePreferences`, `knock.updatePreferences`).
 *
 * **Testing:**
 * - How would you test the integration with Knock? (Triggering Knock workflows via API/dashboard, observing pushes, checking feed updates).
 * - How can you test the registration of push tokens with Knock?
 * - How would you mock the `@knocklabs/react-native` SDK for unit testing components that use its hooks?
