/**
 * @file GooglePayService.ts
 * @description Service layer for handling interactions directly with Google Pay (Native).
 * This involves using platform-specific APIs or libraries that bridge to the native Google Pay SDK.
 * It's distinct from using Google Pay via gateways like Stripe or Braintree, which often simplify the process.
 * This file includes examples of common functionalities and potential interview discussion points.
 * Note: Requires a library like '@stripe/stripe-react-native' (which supports native GPay) or a dedicated Google Pay library if available, or native modules.

// Discussion points: Part of the PaymentDataRequest configuration passed when initiating the payment. Allows specifying supported card brands and security requirements.

// --- Interview Question: Can you use Google Pay for subscriptions or recurring payments? ---
// Discussion points: Yes, but the flow differs. The initial Google Pay interaction might be used to tokenize the card details securely.
// This token is then saved by your payment processor (e.g., creating a vaulted payment method in Stripe/Braintree) and used for subsequent server-initiated recurring charges. The Google Pay sheet itself isn't typically shown for every recurring payment.

// --- General Interview Questions ---
// - Compare implementing native Google Pay vs. using it through a gateway like Stripe/Braintree. (Pros/Cons: Complexity, control, processor dependency, UI consistency).
// - What backend infrastructure is needed to process Google Pay tokens directly (without a PSP)? (Google Pay API integration, PCI compliance considerations).
// - How do you handle different environments (test vs. production) for Google Pay? (Test environment flags in SDKs, Google Pay test card suite).
// - What are the UI/UX guidelines provided by Google for implementing Google Pay? (Button branding, placement, flow).
