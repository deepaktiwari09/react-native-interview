/**
 * @file ApplePayService.ts
 * @description Service layer for handling interactions directly with Apple Pay (Native).
 * This involves using platform-specific APIs or libraries that bridge to the native PassKit framework.
 * It's distinct from using Apple Pay via gateways like Stripe or Braintree, which often simplify the process.
 * This file includes examples of common functionalities and potential interview discussion points.
 * Note: Requires a library like '@stripe/stripe-react-native' (which supports native Apple Pay) or potentially a dedicated Apple Pay library/native module. Requires specific Xcode configuration (Merchant ID, Capabilities).

// Assuming usage of a library like @stripe/stripe-react-native which provides Apple Pay functionality
import { isApplePaySupported, presentApplePay, confirmApplePayPayment } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native'; // Example using Stripe's RN library

// --- Interview Question: What setup is required (outside of code) to enable Apple Pay in an iOS app? ---
// Discussion points: Apple Developer account, creating a Merchant ID in Apple Developer portal, configuring Apple Pay capabilities in Xcode, potentially certificate setup for direct integration/decryption.

// --- Interview Question: How do you check if Apple Pay is available and the user has cards set up? ---
// Discussion points: Device support (iPhone 6+, relevant iPads/Watches), iOS version, user having cards in Wallet. SDKs provide methods to check readiness.
const checkApplePayReadiness = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  if (Platform.OS !== 'ios') {
    console.log('Apple Pay is only available on iOS.');
    return false;
  }
  console.log('Checking Apple Pay readiness...');
  try {
    // Example using Stripe's library
    const isSupported = await isApplePaySupported();
    console.log(`Apple Pay isSupported: ${isSupported}`);
    // --- Interview Question: What are reasons Apple Pay might be unsupported? ---
    // Discussion: Device/OS incompatibility, parental controls, region restrictions, no cards added to Wallet.
    return isSupported;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking Apple Pay readiness:', error);
    return false;
  }
};

// --- Interview Question: Explain the flow of an Apple Pay transaction from the user's perspective. ---
// Discussion points: User taps Apple Pay button, system sheet appears showing card, amount, merchant, shipping/contact info (if requested). User authenticates (Face ID/Touch ID/Passcode). Sheet confirms success/failure.

// --- Interview Question: Describe the high-level steps involved in presenting the Apple Pay sheet programmatically. ---
// Discussion points: Check readiness, create a Payment Request (PKPaymentRequest equivalent) specifying merchant ID, country code, currency, amount, supported networks, required billing/shipping fields. Present the sheet using the SDK. Handle delegate callbacks/events for authorization, shipping updates, completion.
const presentNativeApplePay = async (amount: number, currency: string, merchantId: string): Promise<{ paymentToken: any; billingContact?: any; shippingContact?: any } | null> => {

    return null;
  }

  // IMPORTANT: The payment token received (PKPaymentToken) contains encrypted payment data.
  // This token MUST be sent to your backend server for decryption and processing via Apple Pay APIs or your payment gateway's API (e.g., Stripe, Braintree).

  // If using Stripe, you typically need a PaymentIntent client_secret from your server first.
  const clientSecretForStripe = 'pi_..._secret_...';

  try {
    // Example using Stripe's presentApplePay
    const { error, paymentMethod } = await presentApplePay({
      cartItems: [{ label: 'Total Amount', amount: amount.toFixed(2), paymentType: 'final' }],
      country: 'US', // Your merchant country code
      currency: currency,
      requiredShippingAddressFields: ['emailAddress', 'phoneNumber'], // Example
      requiredBillingAddressFields: ['name'], // Example
      // merchantIdentifier: merchantId, // Stripe often infers this or sets it during init
    });

    if (error) {
      console.error(`Apple Pay Error: ${error.code}`, error.message);
      // --- Interview Question: How do you handle user cancellation or errors during the Apple Pay flow? ---
      // Discussion: Check error codes (e.g., 'canceled'). Update UI accordingly.
       if (error.code === 'canceled') {
          console.log('User cancelled Apple Pay.');
      }
      return null;
    }

    // --- Interview Question: What happens after the user authenticates the payment in the Apple Pay sheet? ---
    // Discussion: The SDK provides a callback/promise resolution containing the PKPaymentToken (or equivalent representation).
    // If using Stripe, it might return a Stripe PaymentMethod ID instead, having processed the token internally.
    if (paymentMethod) {
        console.log('Apple Pay succeeded via Stripe. PaymentMethod ID:', paymentMethod.id);
        // The actual Apple Pay token (PKPaymentToken) is handled internally by Stripe.
        // You would typically confirm the PaymentIntent on the client (using the clientSecret) or send the PM ID to the server.

        // For a truly *native* integration, you'd get the PKPaymentToken object here.
        const mockApplePayToken = { paymentData: 'encrypted_blob...', transactionIdentifier: `apple_pay_txn_${Date.now()}` }; // Placeholder structure
        console.log('Received mock Apple Pay Token:', mockApplePayToken.transactionIdentifier);
        return { paymentToken: mockApplePayToken /* or paymentMethod.id if using Stripe */ };
    }

    console.log('Apple Pay completed without error but no payment method returned (unexpected).');
    return null;

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Unexpected error presenting Apple Pay:', error);
    return null;
  }
};

// --- Interview Question: What is the structure and content of an Apple Pay Token (PKPaymentToken)? ---
// Discussion points: Contains encrypted payment data (DPAN or network token, cryptogram), transaction details (amount, currency), potentially billing/shipping info. Requires Merchant Identity Certificate on the backend to decrypt (if processing directly) or is handled by the PSP.

// --- Interview Question: After receiving the Apple Pay token on the client, what is the critical next step? ---
// Discussion points: Send the token securely to your backend server immediately. The backend uses this token with Apple's APIs or (more commonly) your payment gateway's server-side SDK (Stripe, Braintree, Adyen etc.) to authorize and capture the payment.
const processApplePayTokenOnServer = async (token: any, amount: number, currency: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  console.log(`Sending Apple Pay token ${token?.transactionIdentifier ?? '...'} to server for processing (Amount: ${amount} ${currency})`);
  try {
    // IMPORTANT: This interaction happens between your app and YOUR backend.
    // Your backend then uses the Apple Pay token with Apple's API or your PSP's API.
    // const response = await fetch('/api/applepay/charge', {
    //   method: 'POST',
    //   headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    //   body: JSON.stringify({ applePayToken: token, amount, currency }), // Send the whole token object
    // });
    // const data = await response.json();
    // if (!response.ok || !data.success) {
    //   throw new Error(data.error || 'Server failed to process Apple Pay transaction');
    // }
    // console.log('Server successfully processed Apple Pay transaction:', data.transactionId);
    // return true;

    // Placeholder simulation
    console.log('Server processed Apple Pay token successfully (simulation). Transaction ID:', `txn_ap_${Date.now()}`);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing Apple Pay token on server:', error);
    // --- Interview Question: How should the client react to payment success/failure reported by the server after sending the token? ---
    // Discussion: Crucially, you must call the completion handler provided by the Apple Pay SDK delegate/callback (`confirmApplePayPayment` in Stripe's case) with the success/failure status. This dismisses the Apple Pay sheet correctly.
    // await confirmApplePayPayment(clientSecretForStripe); // Example for Stripe success
    return false;
  }
};

// --- Interview Question: How do you handle dynamic updates like shipping cost calculation based on address within the Apple Pay flow? ---
// Discussion points: Implement delegate methods/callbacks (e.g., `didSelectShippingContact`). When the user selects a shipping address, this method is called. You calculate the new shipping cost, update the payment summary items, and provide the updated details back to the Apple Pay sheet via a completion handler.

// --- Interview Question: Can Apple Pay be used for recurring payments or subscriptions? ---
// Discussion points: Yes. Similar to Google Pay, the initial Apple Pay transaction is used to securely tokenize the payment information. Your payment processor saves this token (e.g., as a vaulted payment method). Subsequent recurring charges are initiated server-side using the saved token, without showing the Apple Pay sheet again. Apple also supports specific subscription flows within PassKit.

export const ApplePayService = {
  checkApplePayReadiness,
  presentNativeApplePay,
  processApplePayTokenOnServer, // Simulates client-to-server call
  // Note: Requires calling a completion function (like Stripe's confirmApplePayPayment) after server response.
};

// --- General Interview Questions ---
// - Compare implementing native Apple Pay vs. using it through a gateway like Stripe/Braintree. (Pros/Cons: Complexity, control, backend requirements, UI consistency).
// - What backend infrastructure/certificates are needed to process Apple Pay tokens directly? (Merchant Identity Certificate, Session generation, Apple Pay API integration, PCI compliance).
// - How do you handle different environments (sandbox vs. production) for Apple Pay? (Test Merchant IDs, sandbox tester accounts in App Store Connect, test cards).
// - What are the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for using the Apple Pay button and flow?
